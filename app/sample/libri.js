    description: 'Ask any Python aficionado and you\'ll hear that Python programmers have it all: an elegant language that offers object-oriented programming support, a readable, maintainable syntax, integration with C components, and an enormous collection of precoded standard library and extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy to learn but powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming challenges. But what Python programmers have lacked is one concise and clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance in how best to use Python\'s great power. Now Python in a Nutshell fills this need.In the tradition of O\'Reilly\'s \'In a Nutshell\' series, this book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language and its many modules. This comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up all the most frequently needed information--not just about the Python language itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library and the most important third-party extensions.Python in a Nutshell focuses on Python 2.2 (and all its point releases), currently the most stable and widespread Python release. This book includes:\nA fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language itself\nAn explanation of object-oriented programming in Python, covering both the classic and new-style object models\nCoverage of other core topics, including exceptions, modules, strings, and regular expressions\nA quick reference for Python\'s built-in types and functions, as well as the key modules in the Python standard library, including sys, os, time, thread, math, and socket, among many others\nReference material on important third-party extensions, such as Numeric and Tkinter\nInformation about extending Python and embedding it into other applications\nPython in a Nutshell provides a solid, no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the most. This latest addition to the best-selling \'In a Nutshell\' series will immediately earn its place in any Python programmer\'s library.**Review\'Brave beginners will be well served by this title, which provides an intelligent, fast paced intro to core topics.\' - Martin Howse, LinuxUser &amp; Developer, Issue 30 \'I whole-heartedly recommend this book to all Python programmers. It is a very concise and informative book, and its small size belies its information content. I would also recommend and suggest this book to any experienced programmers wishing to begin programming in Python, who would enjoy a straight-to-the-point manual on the Python language.\' - Daire Stockdale, Cvu/ACCU About the Author\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Martelli spent 8 years with IBM Research, winning three Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards.

Although at its core, this is a book for programmers, by programmers, only Part II (Technologies) is significantly technical, while the rest should be accessible to technical and non-technical audiences alike.\nIf you\u2019re at all interested in startups\u2014whether you\u2019re a programmer at the beginning of your career, a seasoned developer bored with large company politics, or a manager looking to motivate your engineers\u2014this book is for you.\n**Review\n\'I wish I\'d had a book like this when I was getting my start in the industry.\' - Jay Kreps, CEO, Confluent Inc\n\'Jim will give you a guided and well-informed look at what it takes to build a software startup. There is no jargon or fluff--just practical, simple, and proven advice, presented in an easily readable book.\' - Eugene Mirkin, Entrepreneur in Residence, Array Ventures\nFrom the Author\nI wish I had a book like Hello, Startup back when I was in college. By the time I graduated, I had a BS, a Masters, a bunch of internship experiences--and absolutely no idea what I was doing. What technologies should I learn and use? How do I build a user interface that doesn\'t look terrible? How do I negotiate a job offer? Should I negotiate for more salary or more equity? What is equity, anyway? Should I work at a large company or join a startup?\nI learned the answers to these questions, and many others, the hard way--through trial and error. I also learned that thousands of other developers before me went through the same inefficient trial and error process. It doesn\'t have to be this way. While there are a small number of lessons that you can only learn by making your own mistakes, my hope is that you can learn everything else by studying the successes, failures, and stories in Hello, Startup.',

But to truly master Linux, you need to understand its internals, like how the system boots, how networking works, and what the kernel actually does.In this completely revised second edition of the perennial best seller How Linux Works, author Brian Ward makes the concepts behind Linux internals accessible to anyone curious about the inner workings of the operating system. Inside, you\u2019ll find the kind of knowledge that normally comes from years of experience doing things the hard way. You\u2019ll learn:* How Linux boots, from boot loaders to init implementations (systemd, Upstart, and System V)* How the kernel manages devices, device drivers, and processes* How networking, interfaces, firewalls, and servers work* How development tools work and relate to shared libraries* How to write effective shell scriptsYou\u2019ll also explore the kernel and examine key system tasks inside user space, including system calls, input and output, and filesystems.

    description: 'This book is about different techniques that help us architect software in a better and more efficient way with microservices packed as immutable containers, tested and deployed continuously to servers that are automatically provisioned with configuration management tools. It\'s about fast, reliable and continuous deployments with zero-downtime and ability to roll-back. It\'s about scaling to any number of servers, design of self-healing systems capable of recuperation from both hardware and software failures and about centralized logging and monitoring of the cluster.In other words, this book envelops the whole microservices development and deployment lifecycle using some of the latest and greatest practices and tools. We\'ll use Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Ubuntu, Docker Swarm and Docker Compose, Consul, etcd, Registrator, confd, and so on. We\'ll go through many practices and even more tools. Finally, while there will be a lot of theory, this is a hands-on book. You won\'t be able to complete it by reading it in a metro on a way to work. You\'ll have to read this book while in front of the computer and get your hands dirty.\n**About the Author\nViktor Farcic is a Senior Consultant at CloudBees.

    description: 'Python\u2019s simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren\u2019t using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you\u2019ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best\u2014and possibly most neglected\u2014features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python\u2019s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.This book covers:\nPython data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects\nData structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age\nFunctions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns\nObject-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance\nControl flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages\nMetaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work\n**Book DescriptionClear, Concise, and Effective Programming From the AuthorWho This Book Is For\nThis book was written for practicing Python programmers who want to become proficient in Python 3. If you know Python 2 but are willing to migrate to Python 3.4 or later, you should be fine. [...]  If you are not sure whether you know enough Python to follow along, review the topics of the official Python Tutorial. Topics covered in the tutorial will not be explained here, except for some features that are new in Python 3.  Who This Book Is Not For\nIf you are just learning Python, this book is going to be hard to follow. Not only that, if you read it too early in your Python journey, it may give you the impression that every Python script should leverage special methods and metaprogramming tricks. Premature abstraction is as bad as premature optimization.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(extracted from the Preface, page xvi, emphasis added)\u00a0',

    description: 'Hacking is the art of creative problem solving, whether that means finding an unconventional solution to a difficult problem or exploiting holes in sloppy programming. Many people call themselves hackers, but few have the strong technical foundation needed to really push the envelope.\nRather than merely showing how to run existing exploits, author Jon Erickson explains how arcane hacking techniques actually work. To share the art and science of hacking in a way that is accessible to everyone, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition introduces the fundamentals of C programming from a hacker\'s perspective.\nThe included LiveCD provides a complete Linux programming and debugging environment-all without modifying your current operating system. Use it to follow along with the book\'s examples as you fill gaps in your knowledge and explore hacking techniques on your own. Get your hands dirty debugging code, overflowing buffers, hijacking network communications, bypassing protections, exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, and perhaps even inventing new exploits. This book will teach you how to:\n\nProgram computers using C, assembly language, and shell scripts\nCorrupt system memory to run arbitrary code using buffer overflows and format strings\nInspect processor registers and system memory with a debugger to gain a real understanding of what is happening\nOutsmart common security measures like nonexecutable stacks and intrusion detection systems\nGain access to a remote server using port-binding or connect-back shellcode, and alter a server\'s logging behavior to hide your presence\nRedirect network traffic, conceal open ports, and hijack TCP connections \nCrack encrypted wireless traffic using the FMS attack, and speed up brute-force attacks using a password probability matrix \n\nHackers are always pushing the boundaries, investigating the unknown, and evolving their art. Even if you don\'t already know how to program, Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition will give you a complete picture of programming, machine architecture, network communications, and existing hacking techniques. Combine this knowledge with the included Linux environment, and all you need is your own creativity.\n**About the Author\nJon Erickson has a formal education in computer science and has been hacking and programming since he was five years old. He speaks at computer security conferences and trains security teams around the world. Currently, he works as a vulnerability researcher and security specialist in Northern California.',
